# Object_Detection_Using_Transfer_Learning
This project consists of one jupyter noteook file namely Object_Detection_System.ipynb which consists of the python code.
Rest all other files are random images of objects for detection.
You can simply pass the image file in a jpg format and the rest of the detection work will be handled by the Algorithm.
Here i have made use of transfer learning i.e keras.application.MobileV2net for object Detection.
